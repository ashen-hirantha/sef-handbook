# GSoC 2024_Project Idea_Integrated Appointment system

- Project Title
    - Integrated appointment system for ScholarX Platform
- Description of the project (2-5 sentences)
    - One of the key requirements of the ScholarX program is to understand the interactions between the mentees and the mentors. However since most of the meeting / discussion scheduling happens outside the platform, program admins have to rely on manual feedback collections to monitor aspects like frequency of discussions, discussed topics, etc.
- Expected Outcomes
    - Two possible ways to address the issue
        - One shared calendar integrated to the system
        - Individual calendars integrated to the user profiles (mentors)
    - Users will be able to
        - See the availability of the person they are going to schedule a meeting with
        - Click a date on the calendar
        - Select the Time, where the Time Zone will be selected ;
            - automatically as per the local machine time zone or
            - user select the time zone manually
        - Enter the Title of the discussion / meeting
        - Select the details of the participants from a dropdown list (if all mentee / mentor details are in the system) or enter the details manually (Name, Email, etc.)
        - Create a link to the meeting within the window, through Google Meet, Zoom or any other meeting platform integration.
